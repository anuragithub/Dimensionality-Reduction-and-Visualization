# Comparison of various Dimensionality Reduction techiniques and Visualization of the same.

#### We'll compare the most common dimensionality reduction techniques and more importantly there visualization
#### The three techinques being looked at are:
* PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
* t-Sne (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
* UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)

### Dataset:
Dataset being used for above experimentation is the famous digit recognition dataset MNIST dataset. We have used the sklearn library for downloading the same.

### Results:
Following are the visualizations generated by different algorithms:
* PCA (2d)
